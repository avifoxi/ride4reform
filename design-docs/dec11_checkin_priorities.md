Dec 11 -- Priorities!

1) Debug as bugs come up 

2) Covering our past progress with Feature Tests -- overarching user story test

3) Donations controller -- Update payment processing -- copy the logic from RiderReg's controller 

WHAT do Admins do ?
1) can create and destroy other Admins
2) Manually create a donation to a rider from a paper check, associate it to the donor
3) Export Rider information as CSV --
	search by rider
	search all riders who haven't met the fundraising min 
	export all donors
	export all donor 
4) Create new Ride Years, and decide when a Ride Year is live

<!-- //////
when a user makes a donation - this happens

when a user registers, they do this in this order -->
